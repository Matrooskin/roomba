DESCRIPTION HOW TO CONFIGURE VM SERIAL PORT

Because the description in the help and manual is very poor and others have had similar problems, I decided to write this guide after lots of trials.

Original it was posted in the Windows Hosts section for XP guest, but has now added Windows 7 settings.

How to add a physical serial port.
In Guest Settings for Serial Ports set as follow
Port1: Checked
Port Number: COM1
Port Mode: Host Device
Windows Host:
Port/File Path: COM1:
Note the colon in COM1: (not semicolon). I have experienced the guest could become unstable without it. 
For a host port number higher than 9, the naming \\.\comX where X is the port number, is required. This can also be used for a one digit port number.
Linux Host:
Port/File Path: /dev/ttyS1
For other COM port than 1 replace the digit with port number.


Read: $ sudo cat /dev/ttyS1
